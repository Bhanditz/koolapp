## Welcome to KoolApp!

**KoolApp** is a framework for developing applications built in [Kotlin](http://jetbrains.github.com/kotlin/) so that it can be used on the client
side in a browser via JavaScript or on the server side in some JVM process, Servlet or JAXRS system.

The main components of KoolApp today are

* [Kool Camel](http://koolapp.org/camel.html) provides a [kotlin](http://jetbrains.github.com/kotlin/) based DSL for [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/) together with integration with [Kool Streams](http://koolapp.org/streams.html) to provide a typesafe Camel Integration and Event Processing DSL.
* [Kool Streams](http://koolapp.org/streams.html) for working with event streams and Complex Event Processing
* [Kool Templates](http://koolapp.org/templates.html) for creating HTML5 templates for use on the client or server side
