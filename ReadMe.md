## Welcome to KoolApp!

**KoolApp** is a framework for developing applications built in [Kotlin](http://jetbrains.github.com/kotlin/) so that it can be used on the client
side in a browser via JavaScript or on the server side in some JVM process, Servlet or JAXRS system.

The main components of KoolApp today are

* [Kool Streams](koolapp-stream/ReadMe.md] for working with event streams
* [Kool Templates](koolapp-template/ReadMe.md] for creating HTML5 templates for use on the client or server side
